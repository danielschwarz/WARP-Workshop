A simple vvvv patch for syncing csv files from sonic visualizer (audio information) with the audio track and triggering visuals in realtime by information on the track's notes, pitch and volume.

The track has been analyzed with heavy use of the fantastic sonic visualizer and its vamp plugins.

Developed in a one day workshop with Calum Morton (Warp Records) and Studio NAND during Resonate '12.
